*Note: The synthesizer only works on macOS and Linux due to WSL permission errors with audio

# Install instructions for macOS (homebrew)
brew install libao
opam install mm
opam install ao
opam install ocamlsdl2

# Install insutrctions for Ubuntu/WSL
opam install mm
sudo apt-get install libao-dev
opam install ao
opam install ocamlsdl2

# Instructions for running the GUI:

The command 'make main' runs the GUI interface. Press the labeled keys to play
the corresponding note labeled either above or below the square. Below the 
notes, there are clickable settings that can change the waveform or add a 
filter over the played sound. Use the sliders that appear below the filter 
buttons to change the intensity of the filter being applied.

To record your session, click the record button before using the synthesizer. 
Make sure to unclick record to terminate the recording. To register one second
of silence, press the space bar. The recording will be saved in the form of a 
.wav file in the same directory of the source code.

To quit from the GUI interface, press esc or the close button of the native 
window. 

# Instructions for running the Terminal Interface:

The command 'make terminal' runs the terminal interface. You can follow the 
command prompt but an input for frequency (400.0 - 600.0 is the sweet spot), 
the duration of how long your sound will play (an int value), 
waveform (your options are: sine, square, saw, triangle), 
filter (range, adsr, blur, smooth, envelope) and a corresponding intensity 
value for the filter (a float value between 0.0 to 10.0).

An example command would be something like:
"400.0 5 sine adsr 5.0"
This wil run a sine wave with a adsr filter intensity of 5.0 which will play for
5 seconds.

If wanting to run unit waves without any filters, you can simply write nothing
for the parameters of filter and filter intensity.

An example command for a unit wave would be something like:
"400.0 5 square"
This will run a unit square wave for 5 seconds with no 
filters added to the sound.

To quit the terminal interface, simply enter "quit".

# Instructions for running test cases:
Simply run 'make test' to run the test cases for both GUI and filters.
