# Instructions for running the GUI:


# Instructions for running the Terminal Interface:

The command 'make terminal' runs the terminal interface. You can follow the 
command prompt but an input for frequency (400.0 - 600.0 is the sweet spot), 
the duration of how long your sound will play (an int value), 
waveform (your options are: sine, square, saw, triangle), 
filter (range, adsr, blur, smooth, envelope) and a corresponding intensity 
value for the filter (a float value between 0.0 to 10.0).

An example command would be something like:
"400.0 5 sine adsr 5.0"
This wil run a sine wave with a adsr filter intensity of 5.0 which will play for
5 seconds.

If wanting to run unit waves without any filters, you can simply write nothing
for the parameters of filter and filter intensity.

An example command for a unit wave would be something like:
"400.0 5 square"
This will run a unit square wave for 5 seconds with no 
filters added to the sound.

To quit the terminal interface, simply enter "quit".

# Instructions for running test cases:
Simply run 'make test' to run the test cases for both GUI and filters.
